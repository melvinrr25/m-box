# MBX

Small library that allows us to create nice alerts in our applications or websites.

## How to use it?
### 1. Include the library in your website.
```html
<script src="mbx.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

### 2. Creating a basic alert.

```html
<script>
  mbx.display({
    title: "Atention!",
    content: 'Are you sure?'
  });
</script>
```
### 3. Creating an alert with custom styles

```html
<script>
  mbx.display({
    title: "Atention!",
    content: 'Do you want to send the email after creating this record?',
    styles: {
      '[class*="mbx-button-1"]': {
        background: '#499b49'
      },
      '[class*="mbx-button-2"]': {
        background: '#dd4848'
      }
    },
    buttons: [
      {
        label: 'Yes',
      },
      {
        label: 'No',
      },
    ]

  });
</script>
```
##### The styles key supports any selector allowed by css.
Classes generated by mbx will generate class like `.mbx-button-1`, the number at the end of the buttons class depends on the numbers of buttons in the alert. it means that if we have 2 button in the alert we will have `.mbx-button-1`, `.mbx-button-2` . That way we can add custom styles on our buttons if we really want to.

#
#### List of classes gerenerated by mbx.
`.mbx-base` -> Alert base.

`.mbx-body` -> Alert body container.

`.mbx-close` -> Button that closes the alert.

`.mbx-title` -> Alert title area.

`.mbx-content` -> Alert content.

`.mbx-buttons-area` -> Alert buttons area.

 ### 4. Adding extra buttons to our alerts.
To do so you only have to provide a buttons key and assign to it an array with objects, each object in the array will be a button, the allowed attributes for each button are: `label` (expecting a string), `onClick` (expecting a function), as seen before styles can be added on our buttons.
 #

```html
<script>
  mbx.display({
    content: 'Do you want to send the email after creating this record?',
    buttons: [
      {
        label: 'Yes',
      },
      {
        label: 'No',
      },
      {
        label: 'Maybe',
      },
    ]
  });
</script>
```
### 5. Adding actions to our buttons.
The `onClick` property accepts a function as value, in this case we can create even a new alert when the user clicks the button. Every time you call the property `display` for `mbx` object, it closes the current alert and opens a new alert. if you need to close the current alert you will need to invoke the `close` function for `mbx` like this `mbx.close()`. This will close the current alert.    
#

```html
<script>
  mbx.display({
    title: "Hey!",
    content: 'The file was uploaded',
    buttons: [
      {
        label: 'OK',
        onClick: function () {
          mbx.display({
            title: 'Second alert',
            content: 'You clicked the button',
          });
        }
      },
    ]
  });
</script>
```
